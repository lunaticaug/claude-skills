## Core Methodology: The Planning Cycle

This skill follows a four-phase interactive cycle:

### Phase 1: Discovery & Goal Clarification

To begin the planning process, use closed questions and case examples to efficiently gather information:

**Structured Discovery Questions (Closed Format):**

**Goal Identification:**
1. What is the specific exam/certification/skill? **[Exact name]**
2. Is this required for: job/promotion/personal interest? **[Pick one]**
3. Target completion date: **[Specific date or month]**

**Current State:**
4. Background in this subject: none/basic/intermediate/advanced? **[Pick one]**
5. Have you attempted this before? **[Yes/No]**
   - If yes: What was the result? **[Passed some sections/Failed/Incomplete]**

**Time & Resources:**
6. Work status: full-time/part-time/student/unemployed? **[Pick one]**
7. Weekly study hours available: <10 / 10-15 / 15-20 / 20+ ? **[Pick one]**
8. Budget for materials: <$500 / $500-1500 / $1500-3000 / $3000+ ? **[Pick one]**

**Learning Preferences:**
9. Preferred format: video courses/textbooks/practice problems/mix? **[Pick 1-2]**
10. Study schedule preference: daily consistent/weekend intensive/flexible? **[Pick one]**
11. Accountability need: high (need structure)/medium/low (self-directed)? **[Pick one]**

**Discovery Approach - Present Cases First:**

After understanding the basic goal, present 3-4 relevant case studies:

"I've seen several successful approaches for [their goal]. Let me share some cases:

**Case 1: [Profile Type A]**
- Background: [Similar to user's background]
- Timeline: [X months/weeks]
- Resources used: [Specific materials]
- Study pattern: [Schedule description]
- Result: [Outcome and score if applicable]

**Case 2: [Profile Type B]**
- Background: [Different approach]
- Timeline: [Y months/weeks]
- Resources used: [Different materials]
- Study pattern: [Different schedule]
- Result: [Outcome]

**Case 3: [Profile Type C]**
- [Similar structure]

Looking at these cases:
1. Which timeline feels most realistic for you? **[A/B/C]**
2. Which resource approach fits your budget? **[A/B/C]**
3. Which study pattern matches your schedule? **[A/B/C]**"

**Pattern Recognition Questions:**

After presenting cases, help users identify common success factors:
- "All three cases spent 300-500 total hours. Does that match your expectation? **[Yes/No/Need adjustment]**"
- "Two used intensive review courses, one used budget resources. Both worked. Which direction appeals to you? **[Intensive/Budget/Hybrid]**"
- "The fastest completion was 4 months with 25 hrs/week. The longest was 12 months with 10 hrs/week. Where do you fall? **[Fast/Medium/Extended]**"

**Constraint Identification (Closed Questions):**
- Work schedule: "Do you work: standard hours (9-5)/shifts/flexible/weekends?" **[Pick one]**
- Family: "Do you have: young children/school-age children/elderly care/no dependents?" **[Pick applicable]**
- Location: "Can you study: at home/library/office/commute?" **[Pick all applicable]**
- Deadlines: "Is your target date: firm deadline/flexible/no deadline?" **[Pick one]**

### Phase 2: Information Gathering & Research

After understanding the goal, conduct targeted research to inform the plan:

**Research Activities:**
- Use WebSearch to find current exam formats, requirements, and pass rates
- Search for recommended study materials, textbooks, and courses
- Identify official resources (exam boards, certification bodies)
- Find study strategies and tips from successful candidates
- Locate practice exams, question banks, and study aids
- Research typical study timelines and preparation schedules

**For CPA Exam Example:**
- Search for current CPA exam structure (FAR, AUD, REG, BEC)
- Find AICPA official resources and blueprints
- Identify popular review courses (Becker, Wiley, Surgent, etc.)
- Research state-specific requirements
- Find passing rates and difficulty assessments by section

**Research Output Format:**
Present findings in a clear summary:
```
## Research Summary: [Goal Name]

### Exam/Goal Overview
- Format: [structure, sections, question types]
- Duration: [typical preparation time]

### Key Success Factors
- [Critical strategies from successful candidates]
- [Common pitfalls to avoid]
- [Time management recommendations]
```

### Phase 3: Plan Development

Based on discovery and research, create a structured, actionable learning plan:

**Plan Components:**

**1. Goal Breakdown**
- Break the main goal into concrete milestones
- Identify prerequisite knowledge and skills
- Sequence topics in logical learning order

**2. Resource Allocation**
- Map specific resources to each milestone
- Assign time estimates for each section
- Budget for materials if needed

**3. Schedule Creation**
- Calculate total study hours needed
- Distribute hours across available weeks
- Build in buffer time (15-20% contingency)
- Schedule review and practice periods
- Plan for mock exams or practice tests

**4. Progress Tracking Mechanisms**
- Define measurable checkpoints
- Create assessment criteria for each milestone
- Suggest tools for tracking (spreadsheets, apps)

**Plan Template Structure:**

```markdown
# [Goal] Study Plan

## Target Information
- Goal: [Specific exam/skill]
- Start Date: [Date]
- Target Date: [Date]

```

### Phase 4: Refinement & Iteration

After presenting the initial plan, work with the user to refine:

**Refinement Questions:**
1. Does this timeline feel realistic given your schedule?
2. Are there any phases that feel too rushed or too slow?
3. Do you have access to the recommended resources, or do we need alternatives?
4. Are there specific areas where you need more depth?
5. How does this align with your learning style preferences?

**Adjustment Guidelines:**
- Be flexible - plans should serve the user, not constrain them
- Offer trade-offs clearly (faster pace = more hours/week or less depth)
- Provide alternative approaches (intensive vs. distributed, linear vs. spiral)
- Suggest parallel vs. sequential topic coverage based on user preference

## Special Considerations

### For Professional Exams (CPA, Bar, Medical Boards)
- Emphasize official exam blueprints and content outlines
- Integrate review courses with practice questions (70/30 or 60/40 split)
- Plan for multiple practice exams under timed conditions
- Account for application deadlines and scheduling windows
- Include ethics or professional responsibility components if required

### For Skill Development (Programming, Languages, etc.)
- Focus on project-based milestones
- Balance theory with hands-on practice (typically 30/70 split)
- Include portfolio-building activities
- Suggest real-world application opportunities
- Incorporate community learning (code reviews, language partners)

### For Academic Course Planning
- Align with academic calendar and deadlines
- Balance course load with difficulty levels
- Include prerequisite checking
- Account for office hours, study groups, and TA sessions
- Plan for assignment and exam schedules

## Interactive Conversation Flow

Throughout the process, maintain an engaging, supportive dialogue:

**Conversation Principles:**
1. **Case-based inductive learning**: Present multiple concrete examples, then help users discover patterns and common principles
2. **Closed questions for efficiency**: Use specific, targeted questions to gather key information quickly
3. **Active listening**: Reflect back what you hear to ensure understanding
4. **Encouraging tone**: Acknowledge concerns while maintaining optimism
5. **Collaborative language**: "Let's work together" vs. "You should do this"

**Case-Based Pattern Discovery Approach:**

Instead of asking abstract questions, present concrete cases and guide pattern recognition:

*Example: Understanding study timeline needs*
"Let me show you three successful CPA preparation cases:
- Case A: Full-time accountant, studied 15 hrs/week for 8 months (480 total hours)
- Case B: Recent graduate, studied 25 hrs/week for 5 months (500 total hours)
- Case C: Career changer, studied 10 hrs/week for 12 months (480 total hours)

Looking at these patterns:
1. Are you currently working full-time, part-time, or available for full-time study?
2. What's your target completion timeline: under 6 months, 6-12 months, or 12+ months?
3. Based on these cases, which pattern most closely matches your situation?"

*Example: Resource selection through cases*
"Here are three common resource strategies that work:
- Intensive course approach: Becker or Wiley (comprehensive but expensive ~$3k)
- Hybrid approach: Wiley CPA Excel + free YouTube lectures (~$1.5k)
- Budget approach: Ninja CPA + free resources + library books (~$500)

All three work - the difference is learning style and budget:
1. Do you prefer structured video courses or self-paced reading?
2. What's your budget range: under $500, $500-$1500, or $1500+?
3. Do you need accountability features (live classes, deadlines) or are you self-motivated?"

**Closed Question Patterns:**

*For goal clarification:*
- "What is your target exam date?" (not "When were you thinking of taking it?")
- "How many hours per week can you commit?" (not "How much time do you have?")
- "Have you taken this exam before: yes/no?" (not "What's your background with this?")

*For constraint identification:*
- "Do you have work/family commitments during: weekdays, weekends, or both?"
- "Is your schedule: fixed weekly, variable, or project-based?"
- "Can you study in: mornings, afternoons, evenings, or only weekends?"

*For preference discovery:*
- "Do you learn better through: videos, reading, or hands-on practice?"
- "Do you prefer: one topic at a time (blocking) or mixing topics (interleaving)?"
- "For difficult material, do you prefer: deep dives or multiple quick passes?"

**Sample Dialogue with Closed Questions:**

"I see you want to prepare for the CPA exam. Let me ask you some specific questions:

1. Current status: Are you working full-time? **[Yes/No]**
2. Accounting background: Do you have a degree in accounting? **[Yes/No]**
3. Weekly availability: Can you commit 15+ hours per week? **[Yes/No]**
4. Target timeline: Do you want to complete within 6 months? **[Yes/No]**
5. Budget: Can you invest $1,000+ in materials? **[Yes/No]**

Based on your answers, here are 2-3 proven approaches used by people in similar situations:
[Present specific case examples matching their profile]

Which of these resonates with your situation?"

## Tools and Resources Integration

When appropriate, use available tools to enhance the planning process:

**WebSearch**: For finding current exam information, study materials, and strategies
**WebFetch**: For accessing specific resource pages, official guidelines, or detailed articles
**Read**: If user provides existing study materials or notes to integrate
**Write**: For creating structured plan documents, schedules, or tracking templates

## Output Deliverables

At the end of the planning session, provide:

1. **Comprehensive Study Plan**: Structured markdown document with timeline, resources, and milestones
2. **Resource List**: Curated list of materials with links and descriptions
3. **Progress Tracking Template**: Simple framework for monitoring advancement
4. **Quick Reference Guide**: One-page summary of key dates, goals, and priorities

## Adapting the Plan Over Time

Encourage users to treat the plan as a living document:

**When to Revisit:**
- After completing each major phase
- When progress is significantly ahead or behind schedule
- When circumstances change (work schedule, personal commitments)
- After practice exam results reveal knowledge gaps

**Adjustment Strategies:**
- Reallocate time from mastered topics to challenging areas
- Compress or extend phases based on actual learning pace
- Swap resources if initial choices aren't effective
- Add or remove review sessions based on retention

## Example Use Cases

### Example 1: CPA Exam Preparation

*User request:* "Help me plan my CPA exam study - I want to take all 4 sections within 8 months"

*Skill activation:* Conduct discovery to learn background, research CPA requirements, create phased study plan with section sequencing, integrate review course recommendations, schedule practice exams, provide tracking template.

### Example 2: Learning Python for Data Science

*User request:* "I want to transition into data science and need to learn Python - where do I start?"

*Skill activation:* Clarify current technical background and career timeline, research Python learning paths for data science, create project-based learning plan with portfolio milestones, recommend courses and books, suggest practice datasets and kaggle competitions.

### Example 3: Graduate School Application Planning

*User request:* "I'm applying to MBA programs next year - help me plan my preparation"

*Skill activation:* Explore target schools and requirements, research GMAT/GRE preparation timelines, create comprehensive plan covering test prep, application essays, recommendations, and interviews, timeline all deadlines, provide checklist.

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Start with open-ended questions to understand context
- Validate constraints and assumptions explicitly
- Present options rather than single solutions
- Break overwhelming goals into manageable chunks
- Celebrate milestones and build in rewards
- Use realistic time estimates (avoid aggressive overpacking)
- Account for learning curves and difficulty variations

**Don't:**
- Make assumptions about user's background without asking
- Create rigid plans that don't accommodate life changes
- Overwhelm with too many resources (curate to top 3-5)
- Ignore user's learning style preferences
- Skip the research phase (plans should be evidence-based)
- Forget to include review and consolidation time
- Create plans that front-load all difficulty

## Conclusion

This skill transforms vague learning aspirations into concrete, actionable plans through structured brainstorming, thorough research, and collaborative refinement. The interactive approach ensures plans are personalized, realistic, and adaptable to each user's unique circumstances and learning style.
