# Brainstorming & Planning for Learning Goals

## Overview

This skill provides a structured, interactive approach to brainstorming and creating comprehensive learning plans. It guides users through goal clarification, resource discovery, and actionable plan development using a conversational, Socratic method.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users request help with:
- Exam preparation planning (CPA, bar exam, medical boards, certification exams)
- Course or curriculum development
- Skill acquisition roadmaps
- Learning goal brainstorming
- Study schedule creation
- Career development planning
- Personal education projects

## Core Methodology: The Planning Cycle

This skill follows a four-phase interactive cycle:

### Phase 1: Discovery & Goal Clarification

To begin the planning process, conduct a discovery conversation with the user:

**Initial Questions to Ask:**
1. What specific goal or exam are you preparing for?
2. What's your current knowledge level or experience with this subject?
3. What's your target completion date or deadline?
4. How much time can you dedicate per week?
5. What learning style works best for you? (visual, reading, practice-based, etc.)
6. Have you attempted this before? If so, what worked or didn't work?
7. What specific challenges do you anticipate?

**Discovery Guidelines:**
- Ask 2-3 questions at a time to avoid overwhelming the user
- Use follow-up questions to drill deeper into vague responses
- Help users articulate implicit constraints (work schedule, family commitments, budget)
- Identify both intrinsic motivations (career growth, personal interest) and extrinsic pressures (deadlines, requirements)

### Phase 2: Information Gathering & Research

After understanding the goal, conduct targeted research to inform the plan:

**Research Activities:**
- Use WebSearch to find current exam formats, requirements, and pass rates
- Search for recommended study materials, textbooks, and courses
- Identify official resources (exam boards, certification bodies)
- Find study strategies and tips from successful candidates
- Locate practice exams, question banks, and study aids
- Research typical study timelines and preparation schedules

**For CPA Exam Example:**
- Search for current CPA exam structure (FAR, AUD, REG, BEC)
- Find AICPA official resources and blueprints
- Identify popular review courses (Becker, Wiley, Surgent, etc.)
- Research state-specific requirements
- Find passing rates and difficulty assessments by section

**Research Output Format:**
Present findings in a clear summary:
```
## Research Summary: [Goal Name]

### Exam/Goal Overview
- Format: [structure, sections, question types]
- Duration: [typical preparation time]
- Difficulty: [based on pass rates and reviews]

### Recommended Resources
1. Official resources: [links and descriptions]
2. Study materials: [top-rated courses, books, materials]

4. Community resources: [forums, study groups, subreddits]

### Key Success Factors
- [Critical strategies from successful candidates]
- [Common pitfalls to avoid]
- [Time management recommendations]
```

### Phase 3: Plan Development

Based on discovery and research, create a structured, actionable learning plan:

**Plan Components:**

**1. Goal Breakdown**
- Break the main goal into concrete milestones
- Identify prerequisite knowledge and skills
- Sequence topics in logical learning order

**2. Resource Allocation**
- Map specific resources to each milestone
- Assign time estimates for each section
- Budget for materials if needed

**3. Schedule Creation**
- Calculate total study hours needed
- Distribute hours across available weeks
- Build in buffer time (15-20% contingency)
- Schedule review and practice periods
- Plan for mock exams or practice tests

**4. Progress Tracking Mechanisms**
- Define measurable checkpoints
- Create assessment criteria for each milestone
- Suggest tools for tracking (spreadsheets, apps)

**Plan Template Structure:**

```markdown
# [Goal] Study Plan

## Target Information
- Goal: [Specific exam/skill]
- Start Date: [Date]
- Target Date: [Date]
- Total Weeks: [Number]
- Weekly Commitment: [Hours]

- Weekly assessment: [Review method]
- Adjustment triggers: [When to revise the plan]
```

### Phase 4: Refinement & Iteration

After presenting the initial plan, work with the user to refine:

**Refinement Questions:**
1. Does this timeline feel realistic given your schedule?
2. Are there any phases that feel too rushed or too slow?
3. Do you have access to the recommended resources, or do we need alternatives?
4. Are there specific areas where you need more depth?
5. How does this align with your learning style preferences?

**Adjustment Guidelines:**
- Be flexible - plans should serve the user, not constrain them
- Offer trade-offs clearly (faster pace = more hours/week or less depth)
- Provide alternative approaches (intensive vs. distributed, linear vs. spiral)
- Suggest parallel vs. sequential topic coverage based on user preference

## Special Considerations

### For Professional Exams (CPA, Bar, Medical Boards)
- Emphasize official exam blueprints and content outlines
- Integrate review courses with practice questions (70/30 or 60/40 split)
- Plan for multiple practice exams under timed conditions
- Account for application deadlines and scheduling windows
- Include ethics or professional responsibility components if required

### For Skill Development (Programming, Languages, etc.)
- Focus on project-based milestones
- Balance theory with hands-on practice (typically 30/70 split)
- Include portfolio-building activities
- Suggest real-world application opportunities
- Incorporate community learning (code reviews, language partners)

### For Academic Course Planning
- Align with academic calendar and deadlines
- Balance course load with difficulty levels
- Include prerequisite checking
- Account for office hours, study groups, and TA sessions
- Plan for assignment and exam schedules

## Interactive Conversation Flow

Throughout the process, maintain an engaging, supportive dialogue:

**Conversation Principles:**
1. **Socratic questioning**: Help users discover insights rather than prescribing solutions
2. **Active listening**: Reflect back what you hear to ensure understanding
3. **Encouraging tone**: Acknowledge concerns while maintaining optimism
4. **Concrete examples**: Use specific scenarios to illustrate abstract concepts
5. **Collaborative language**: "Let's work together" vs. "You should do this"

**Sample Dialogue Patterns:**

*When exploring goals:*
"I notice you mentioned wanting to pass the CPA exam. Could you tell me more about what's driving this goal right now? Is it for a specific job opportunity, career advancement, or personal achievement?"

*When discussing constraints:*
"You mentioned you can study 15 hours per week. Help me understand what that looks like - are those hours spread evenly across the week, or concentrated on weekends? Are there weeks that might be more or less available?"

*When presenting research:*
"Based on what I've found, most successful CPA candidates spend 300-400 hours total across all four sections. Given your accounting background, you might be on the lower end of that range. Does that align with your expectations?"

*When reviewing the plan:*
"Looking at this schedule, I've got you studying FAR first since it's the foundation for other sections. Some people prefer starting with their strongest section for confidence. What feels right for you?"

## Tools and Resources Integration

When appropriate, use available tools to enhance the planning process:

**WebSearch**: For finding current exam information, study materials, and strategies
**WebFetch**: For accessing specific resource pages, official guidelines, or detailed articles
**Read**: If user provides existing study materials or notes to integrate
**Write**: For creating structured plan documents, schedules, or tracking templates

## Output Deliverables

At the end of the planning session, provide:

1. **Comprehensive Study Plan**: Structured markdown document with timeline, resources, and milestones
2. **Resource List**: Curated list of materials with links and descriptions
3. **Progress Tracking Template**: Simple framework for monitoring advancement
4. **Quick Reference Guide**: One-page summary of key dates, goals, and priorities

## Adapting the Plan Over Time

Encourage users to treat the plan as a living document:

**When to Revisit:**
- After completing each major phase
- When progress is significantly ahead or behind schedule
- When circumstances change (work schedule, personal commitments)
- After practice exam results reveal knowledge gaps

**Adjustment Strategies:**
- Reallocate time from mastered topics to challenging areas
- Compress or extend phases based on actual learning pace
- Swap resources if initial choices aren't effective
- Add or remove review sessions based on retention

- Validate constraints and assumptions explicitly
- Present options rather than single solutions
- Break overwhelming goals into manageable chunks
- Celebrate milestones and build in rewards
- Use realistic time estimates (avoid aggressive overpacking)
- Account for learning curves and difficulty variations

**Don't:**
- Make assumptions about user's background without asking
- Create rigid plans that don't accommodate life changes
- Overwhelm with too many resources (curate to top 3-5)
- Ignore user's learning style preferences
- Skip the research phase (plans should be evidence-based)
- Forget to include review and consolidation time
- Create plans that front-load all difficulty

## Conclusion

This skill transforms vague learning aspirations into concrete, actionable plans through structured brainstorming, thorough research, and collaborative refinement. The interactive approach ensures plans are personalized, realistic, and adaptable to each user's unique circumstances and learning style.
